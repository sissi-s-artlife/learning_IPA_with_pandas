## Introduction
The IPA Symbol Checker is a handy tool for linguists, language enthusiasts, and students, offering a straightforward method to explore the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA). This project leverages Python and Pandas, making it a blend of linguistic insight and technical functionality.

## About the IPA
The International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) is a cornerstone for those studying or working with languages, providing a universal system for phonetic notation. This tool assists users in connecting symbols with their corresponding sounds, enriching their phonetic understanding.

## Key Features
- **IPA Symbol Lookup**: Effortlessly find the description of an IPA symbol.
- **Sound Description Lookup**: Easily retrieve the IPA symbol linked to a given sound description.
- **Interactive Session**: Conduct multiple queries in one session, courtesy of the looping feature.

## Prerequisites
- **Python**: The core programming language of this project.
- **Pandas**: A Python library used for efficient data manipulation and analysis.

These tools should be installed on your machine to utilize the IPA Symbol Checker effectively.

## Usage
Simply run the script within your Python environment. The program will prompt you through a series of choices, allowing you to search by IPA symbol or sound description. After inputting your query, it displays the relevant information. You have the option to continue with more queries or exit the program.

## Contribution
